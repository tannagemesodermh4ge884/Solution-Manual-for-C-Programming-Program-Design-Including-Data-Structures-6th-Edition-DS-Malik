  * C++ PROGRAMMING: PROGRAM DESIGN INCLUDING DATA STRUCTURES, Sixth Edition remains the definitive text for the CS1/CS2 course sequence. D.S. Malik's time-tested, student-centered methodology uses a strong focus on problem-solving and full-code examples to vividly demonstrate the how and why of applying programming concepts and utilizing C++ to work through a problem. This new edition includes updated end-of-chapter exercises, new debugging exercises, an earlier introduction to variables and a streamlined discussion of user-discussion of user-defined functions. Malik's text ensures students learn how to apply the C++ programming language, and are motivated to understand the "why?" behind key C++ concepts.
